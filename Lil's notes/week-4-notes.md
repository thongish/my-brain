##### Implementation
--- 
- the process of putting a planned solution, change, or initiative into action within an organization
- once a new system is developed and tested, its implemented into the organization
- phase includes training the users, providing documentation, and data conversion from previous to new system
- can take many forms, depending on the type of system. the number and types of users and how urgent it is that the system becomes operational

##### Implementation Methodologies
---
**Direct Cutover** - also known as the "big bang" approach, direct cutover involves switching from the old system to a new one at a specific point in time. The old system is completely shut down, and the new system goes live immediately.

**Advantages**:
- Quick implementation.
- Minimal overlap between systems.
- Cost-effective in the short term as only one system is operational.

**Disadvantages**:
- High risk if the new system fails, as there is no fallback.
- Potential for significant disruption if users encounter problems.
- **Best For**: Smaller systems or situations where immediate switch-over is essential, and the risks can be managed.

**Parallel Operation** - both old system and the new system run concurrently for a specific period. Users input data into both systems until the new system is proven reliable.

**Advantages**:
- Low risk, as the old system is available as a backup.
- Allows for thorough testing of the new system in a real environment.

**Disadvantages**:
- High cost and effort, as it requires maintaining both systems.
- Increased workload for users who need to input data into both systems.
- **Best For**: Critical systems where reliability is paramount and where downtime is not an option.

**Pilot Operation** - the new system is introduced in a small, controlled group within the organization (a "pilot group"). Once the system is validated and proven successful in this environment, it is rolled out to the rest of the organization

**Advantages**:
- Limits the impact of issues to a small group, making it easier to identify and fix problems before a full rollout.
- Allows for real-world testing and user feedback.
 
**Disadvantages**:
- Longer time to fully implement the system across the organization.
- May not reveal all potential problems that could arise in a larger-scale deployment.
- **Best For**: Large or complex systems where the organization wants to minimize risk but also gain early feedback.

**Phased Operation** - the new system is implemented in stages, where different parts or modules of the system are introduced over time. Each phase is implemented, tested, and validated before the next phase begins.

**Advantages**:
- Reduces risk by breaking the implementation into manageable steps.
- Provides time for users to adapt to new components gradually.

 **Disadvantages**:
- Can be time-consuming and drawn out.
- Complexity in managing multiple phases and transitions.
- **Best For**: Large, complex systems where a gradual transition minimizes the risk of disruption.

#### Implementation Task
---
1. **Data Conversion**: Transforming data from one format/system to another, ensuring compatibility and accuracy during system migrations.

2. **Training**: Teaching users how to effectively use a new system, typically through workshops, tutorials, and practice sessions.

3. **Documentation**: Creating manuals and guides for users and developers to understand, maintain, and troubleshoot the system.
 
4. **Maintenance**: Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and performance improvements to keep the system running smoothly post-deployment.
