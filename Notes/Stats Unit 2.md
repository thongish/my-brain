# Graphical summaries of numerical data

## Frequency distribution

- The possible values of X are divided into non-overlapping classes (i.e. intervals) of equal width
- The number of times a measurement of X falls into a given class is the *frequency* of that class

### Precision

- The interval of values in the data set
### Class

- **Class limit**
	- Upper class limit
		- The highest value in the range of a class
	- Lower class limit
		- The lowest value in the range of a class
- **Class mark**
	- Average of the lower and upper class limit of a class
- **Class boundaries**
	- Lower class boundary
		- The average of the previous class highest value with the current class we are looking at lowest value
	- Upper class boundary
		- The average of the highest value of the current class we are looking at and the lowest value of the next class
- **Class width**
	- Is the upper boundary minus the lower boundary

- The number of classes should be approximately **n^1/2**, where **n = sample size**

## Histograms

- A histogram is a visual representation of the corresponding frequency distribution
- You need to determine the *class boundaries* to correctly position the left and right sides of the rectangle

# Percentiles and quartiles

**Percentile**
- The k$^t$$^h$ percentile of a numerical variable X is denoted P$_k$ 
- Divides data into two parts:
	- The lower k% of values and the upper (100 - k)% of values
		- The lower k% of values have to be less than P$_k$

- Example: 

- Example: On the Math 12 Provincial exam, Bill scored in the 75th percentile
	- Incorrect: he scored 75/100
	- Correct: he is doing better than 75% of people

**Quartiles**
- Are percentiles in multiples of 25
	- Q1 = P$_2$$_5$
	- Q2 = P$_5$$_0$
	- Q3 = P$_7$$_5$
- Inter-quartile range
	- Q3 - Q1

# Box plots

![[Pasted image 20240911104741.png]]
- A boxplot is a simple way to visualize the *five-number summary*
- Shows the full *range* (distance between min and max values)
- Also shows the range of the middle 50% of the observations (**the box**) which is the **inter-quartile range** (IQR)
