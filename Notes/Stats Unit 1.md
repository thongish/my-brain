# Definitions

**Population**
- The *complete* set of individuals (people, objects, etc.) we want to know about

**Sample**
- A subset of individuals selected from the population

**Sampling frame**
- A *physical* list of all the individuals in a population that we can sample

**Variable**
- Any *number of characteristics* that we could measure for each individual in the population

**Data set**
- A set of measurements of certain variables for individuals in a certain sample (or the entire population)

**Observation** or **measurement** of **X**
- is the value of X for one specific individual

# Methods of sampling

### 1. Random sampling (probability sampling)

![[Pasted image 20240910174136.png]]

**Simple random sample**
- Randomly select a subset of participants from a population

**Systematic sample** 
- Selecting members of the population at a regular interval
	- i.e. Every 5th person on a list of the population
- Find step size by dividing the population by the desired sample size
	- population / sample size = step size

**Stratified sample**
- Divide population into subgroups called **strata** based on characteristics they share (race, gender, etc.)
- Once divided, individuals in each subgroup are selected randomly to be sampled

**Cluster sample**
- Divide population into subgroups called **clusters** 
- Once divided, clusters are selected and sampled


# 2. Non-Random sampling (Non-probability sampling)

![[Pasted image 20240910175920.png]]

**Convenience sample**
- Sampling participants based on convenience
	- i.e. Nearby or easily available people 

**Purposive sample**
- Intentionally selecting participants based on their characteristics, knowledge, experiences, or some other criteria

**Snowball sample**
- Sampling one individual and then sampling individuals referred by the original

**Quota sample**
- Picking participants non-randomly but making sure you've reached a specific number or percentage of participants

# Errors in sampling

>Root cause of sampling errors is the **mismatch between a sampling frame and a population**

1. **Sampling errors**
	- Errors that occur due to the fact that the sampling size is almost always smaller than the population
		- Sample is not fully representative of a population

2. **Non-sampling error**
	- Errors that occur due to human mistakes or machine malfunction

3. **Errors of inclusion**
	- When some individuals are **in the sampling frame** but **are not part of the population**
		- These individuals may be included in the sample which is an error because they aren't part of the population (people we want to know about)

4. **Errors of exclusion**
	- When some individuals are **not in the sampling frame** but **are part of the population**
		- These individuals will never be included in the sample which makes for more inaccurate data

### How to reduce sampling errors

**Sampling errors**
- larger sample size
- similar proportions to the population

**Non-sampling errors**
- Hire people with necessary knowledge and provide training
- Purchase good quality software


# Types of random variables

### Two umbrella types of data

1. **Categorical** (Qualitative)
	- The value of X is a *label* or *word*
		- X = the day of the week of a person's birth
	- Two sub-types
		- **Nominal** variable
			- i.e. days in a week, colors, fruits, etc.
		- **Ordinal** variable
			- i.e. google rating, customer experience survey (rank service 1-5 )
		- Major difference between nominal and ordinal is that nominal variables don't deal with rankings, while ordinal variables have rankings

2. **Numerical** (Quantitative)
	- The value of X is a *number*
		- X = the age of a Canadian in 2010
	- Two sub-types
		- **Ratio** variable
			- i.e. mass, volume, etc.
		- **Interval** variable
			- i.e. temperature (C, F, K)
	- Major difference between ratio and interval variables is that ratio variables have an absolute zero and interval variables don't 
		- 0 degrees Celsius doesn't mean that there is no temperature, but 0 mass means there is no mass

#### Comparing ordinal and interval variables

- Both ordinal and interval variables have rankings
	- A 5 star review is better than a 1 star review
	- 20 degrees Celsius is higher than 0 degrees Celsius

- How do we compare between the two?
	- A 5 star review and a 4 star review has a gap of 1 star
	- A 2 star review and a 1 star review also has a gap of 1 star
	- In both cases are gaps of 1 star equivalent?
		- No! The difference between a 5 star and 4 star review is that one is perfect and the other is slightly less perfect
		- The difference between a 2 star and a 1 star review is that one is bad and the other is really really bad
		- Although the gap looks the same, they may mean different things

	- On the other hand, 20 - 0 = 20 Celsius
	- and 40 - 20 = 20 Celsius
	- In both cases here, there is a gap of 20 degrees Celsius
		- Both gaps of 20 degrees Celsius mean exactly the same thing
			- They are comparable


# Random variables and distributions

- Random variables aren't completely random
- There is usually an underlying "pattern" to X which we call the **distribution** of X
	- i.e. The age of Canadians in 2024
		- The amount of people between the ages 0 and 50 might be fairly similar but going further after age 50, there might be less and less people as age goes higher
			- This is due to the fact that humans have life spans
