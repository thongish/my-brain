# Probability and counting

## Probability theory concepts

**Random experiment**
- An "experiment" is called random if we can neither predict nor control which one of the many possible outcomes of the experiment occur

**Outcome**
- One specific result for the random experiment

**Sample space**
- The set of all possible outcomes for a random experiment

**Event**
- A subset of the sample space (one or more *outcomes*)

**Probability**
- There is a probability with each event which represents the chance that the event will occur

## Counting

## Factorials, permutations, combinations


- sequence = order matters
