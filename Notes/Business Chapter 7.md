# Does I.T matter?

## The productivity paradox

- Despite significant efforts and investments in IT, it is difficult to prove its contribution to productivity
- Various explanations of this paradox can be grouped into four categories:
	- **Mismeasurement** of outputs and inputs
	- **Lags** due to learning and adjustment
	- **Redistribution** and dissipation of profits
	- **Mismanagement** of information and technology
- A study found that sometimes the true advantages in using technology were not directly relatable to higher productivity, but softer measures such as the impact on organizational structure
	- Also found that the impact of IT can vary widely between companies

## Competitive advantage

- A company is said to have a competitive advantage over its rivals when it is able to sustain profits and exceed the average for the industry
- Two primary methods for obtaining **competitive advantage**
	- **Cost advantage**
	- **Differentiation advantage**

## The value chain

- A series of activities undertaken by the company to produce a product or service
- Made up of two sets of activities:
	- **Primary activities**
		- The functions that directly impact the creation of a product or service
		- **Inbound logistics**
			- The processes that bring in raw materials and other needed inputs
			- IT can make this process more efficient i.e. supply-chain management systems
		- **Operations**
			- Any part of a business that converts the raw materials into a final product or service
			- IT can make this process more efficient and increase innovation through flows of information
		- **Outbound logistics**
			- Functions required to get the product out to the customer
			- IT can improve processes such as real-time inventory checks or the delivery mechanism itself
		- **Sales/Marketing**
			- Functions that will entice buyers to purchase the products
			- IT is used in almost all aspects of this activity
				- Online advertising and surveys, innovate product design, company website to make sales
		- **Service**
			- The functions a business performs after the product has been purchased to maintain and enhance the product's value
			- Support services through websites and knowledge bases

	- **Support activities**
		- Functions of an organization that support all the primary activities
		- **Firm infrastructure**
			-  Infrastructure includes finance, accounting, ERP systems, and quality control
				- All of these depend on IT
		- **Human resource management**
			- Recruiting, hiring, and other services needed to attract and retain employees
			- Using internet to increase reach when looking for candidates
			- IT also allows employees to use technology for a more flexible work environment
		- **Technology development**
			- Provides innovation that supports primary activities
			- IT is the primary generator of value in this support activity
		- **Procurement**
			- Focuses on acquisition of raw materials used in the creation of products
			- i.e. business-to-business e-commerce

## Porter's five forces

- A framework for industry analysis
- Can help understand the degree of competition in an industry and analyze its strengths and weaknesses
- Consists of five elements that determine the average profitability of an industry
	- **Threat of substitute products or services**
		- Likelihood of a copycat spawning
		- The internet has made people more aware of copycats
	- **Bargaining power of suppliers**
		- More suppliers to choose from, lower prices
		- Less suppliers to choose from, higher prices
		- Internet has given companies access to more suppliers
	- **Barriers to entry**
		- The easier it is to enter an industry, the harder it will be to make a profit
			- More competition
	- **Rivalry among existing competitors**
		- When rivalry is fierce, each competitor is attempting to gain additional market share from the other
			- Can result in aggressive pricing, increasing customer support, or other factors that might lure a customer away from a competitor
		- Markets with low rivalry are easier to enter and become profitable sooner

## Using IT systems for competitive advantage

- A strategic information system is designed specifically to implement an organizational strategy meant to provide a competitive advantage
	- Attempts to do one or more of the following:
		- Deliver a product or a service at a lower cost
		- Deliver a product or service that is differentiated
		- Help an organization focus on a specific market segment
		- Enable innovation
### Electronic data interchange

- Provides competitive advantage through integrating the supply chain electronically
	- Suppliers and distributors
	- Reduce resources required to manage relevant info
- The computer-to-computer exchange of business documents in a standard electronic format between business partners

### Collaborative systems

- The ability to collaborate in different ways other than the standard face-to-face
- Tools like VOIP, file sharing, project management systems (Trello), Microsoft SharePoint, Google Drive, GitHub

### Decision support systems

- Helps an organization make a specific decision or set of decisions
- Can exist at different levels of decision making from CEO to first level managers
- Designed to take inputs regarding a known (or partially-known) decision making process and provide the info necessary to make a decision
- **Structured decisions**
	- With structured decisions, once you know he necessary info you also know the decision that needs to be made
	- i.e. Inventory is low, order more
	- Good candidates for automation
- **Unstructured decisions**
	- Involves a lot of unknown and many times the unstructured decisions are made for the first time
	- Support system can help by providing decision makers with information gathering tools and collaborative capabilities
	- i.e. dealing with a labor issue or setting policy for implementation of new technology
- **Semi-structured decisions**
	- Decision support system works best here
	- A decision where most factors needed for making the decision are known but human experience and other outside factors may still impact the decision
	- i.e. diagnosing a medical condition
