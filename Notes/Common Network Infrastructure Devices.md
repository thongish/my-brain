#NETWORK/W1

**Router**
- A Layer 3 device that can make forwarding decisions based on logical addresses (i.e. IP addresses)

**Wide Area Network** (WAN)
- A network connection that interconnects geographically separate networks

**Virtual Private Network**
- Allows a secure connection to be setup over an untrusted network
- Creates a virtual tunnel that connects devices over the internet

**Wireless Access Point**
- Communicates with wireless devices (i.e. smart phones, laptops, printers) and interconnects them with a wired network

**Switch**
- A layer 2 device that makes forwarding decisions based on physical addresses (i.e. MAC address)
- Builds MAC address table 

**Network Interface Card** (NIC)
- A card inside of a networked device that allows the device to communicate on a network
- MAC address is burned into this card

**Media Access Control (MAC) Address**
- a 48-bit address burned into a NIC, typically written in hexadecimal notation

**Intrusion Prevention System** (IPS)
- A sensor that **sits in-line** with network traffic
- Can recognize the signature of well-known attacks and stop them

**Intrusion Detection System** (IDS)
- A sensor that **receives a copy** of network traffic
- Can recognize the signature of well-known attacks and stop them
- Not as secure as the IPS

**Firewall**
- A network device that uses a set of rules to determine what traffic to permit or deny between portions (i.e. zones) of a network
	- What can go in and out of the network

**Demilitarized Zone** (DMZ)
- The term typically given to a portion of a network that should be accessible by external devices (i.e. devices on the internet)
- Hosts public-facing services like web, email, and FTP servers which allows them to interact with the external network and therefore, external users

**Firewall Router**
- A router configured to perform firewall functions, in addition to router functions

**Multilayer Switch**
- An ethernet switch that can make forwarding decisions based on Layer 3 (and higher) information (i.e. IP addresses), like a router 
- And can also make decisions based on Layer 2 information (i.e. MAC address), like a Layer 2 Ethernet switch

**Cache Engine**
- Locally stores content retrieved from a remote network (typically the internet) and sends that content to local devices requesting that content, thus saving bandwidth

**Network-Attached Storage (NAS) Device**
- A network appliance that makes storage resources (i.e. large, redundant hard drives) available to network clients

**Bridge**
- A device that joins two or more network segments that 

**Hub**

**Nat router**

What is a **multilayer switch**?
?
- An Ethernet switch that can make forwarding decisions based on Layer 3 (i.e. IP addresses) and Layer 2 (i.e. MAC addresses) information.
