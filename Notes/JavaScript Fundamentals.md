# What is an expression?

- A sequence of **operators** and their **operands**
- Evaluating an expression produces a **result value**
	- Evaluating expressions may generate a **side effect**
		- i.e. evaluating `{js} console.log("BCIT is doodoo")`has a side effect of printing a line of characters in the console

# Data types

- JavaScript programs manipulate data, and each value has a type
- ECMAScript standard defines a few basic data types:
	1. Boolean
	2. Number
	3. String
	4. null and undefined
	5. objects
## Number

- JavaScript uses 64 bits to store numbers
- There are also special numbers in JavaScript:
	- `{js}10 / 0;` = infinity
	- `{js}-10 / -;`= -infinity
	- `{js}0 / 0; `= NaN

# Variables and assignment

- Each variable needs a name, called an **identifier**
- **Identifiers** are the names for values and things in JavaScript
	- Identifier must start with a letter, underscore `{js}_`, or dollar sign `{js}$`; subsequent characters can also be digits `{js}0 to 9`
	- There are 35 keywords in JavaScript that can't be used as identifiers
		- [List of keywords](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar)
- Camel Case example: `{js}thisIsCamelCase`

## How do we name things?

- Use intention-revealing names (why, what, and/or how)  
- Avoid disinformation (no false clues)  
- Make meaningful distinctions (no noise words)  
- Use pronounceable names  
- Use searchable names (no single letter identifiers)  
- Pick one word per concept, i.e., donâ€™t use `{js}sum` and `{js}total` and `{js}aggregate` in the same program
# Operators and operands

## Increment and decrement

- Two ways to add/subtract from a number
	- Postfix
		- `{js}a++` or `{js}a--`
		- Add/subtract 1 to or from `{js}a` and return the old value of `{js}a` while overwriting the original value
	- Prefix
		- `{js}++a` or `{js}--a`
		- Add/subtract 1 to or from `{js}a` and return the new value
