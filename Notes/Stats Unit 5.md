# Probability laws and conditional probability

S = sample space
## Complementary rule

- Sometimes easier to calculate the probability an event **doesn't** happen than **does**
- **Ā** is the complementary event of **A** (the set of outcomes not in A)
- Good in cases where we want to calculate the probability that some event occurs **at least once** in a series of attempts

S = sample space

- P(A) + (Ā) = 1
- P(Ā) = 1 - P(A)
- P(A) = 1 - P(Ā)

## Addition rule

### Mutually exclusive events

1. If **A** and **B** cannot occur simultaneously, then the two events are called **mutually exclusive**
2. P(A union B) = 0 or |A intersection B| = 0

- Implication in the addition rule
	- P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B)

What is a **mutually exclusive event**?::If **A and B** cannot occur simultaneously

What is a **independent event**?::If the probability of **B** does not depend on whether **A** has occurred or not
