# Numeral Summaries of Data

## Summarizing and Presenting One Numerical Variable

To summarize a variable *numerically*, we have two primary types of measures:
- Measures of *center* 
	- "What is a typical or central value of X?"
- Measures of *spread* 
	- "How much does X vary around its center? How spread out is X?"

> We call these measures "statistics" when we are summarizing *sample* data. They are called "parameters" when we are summarizing *population* data


## Measures of center

The three measures of center we will use:
1. Mean
2. Median
3. Mode

### Mean

- The arithmetic *mean* of a numerical data set is the familiar "average"

### Median

- The *median* of a set of numerical values is the *middle* when the values are sorted in *increasing order* 
- The median is denoted by x with ~ on top, or Q$_2$
- For an *odd* number of data values, the median is the exact middle of the data set
	- 20, 40, 53, 64, 75, 82, 99
		- 7 data values, the middle is 64
- For an *even* number of data values, the median is the *mean* of the two middle numbers
	- 12, 23, 27, 30, 70, 80, 90, 91
		- 8 data values, the two middle numbers are 30 and 70
			- Mean of those 2 numbers is 50

### Mode

- The *mode* (also called the *modal value*) of a data set is the value that occurs most *frequently* 
	- If two values of X occur with the same greatest frequency, the data set is said to be *bimodal* 
	- If there are more than two modal values, the data set is said to be *multi-modal*
	- If no value is repeated, we say that there is no mode

## Sensitivity to extreme values

- If a data set contains *extreme* values, which measure of center best describes the *center value*?
	- Generally, the *median* is more representative of the center than the *mean* where there are extreme values since those values "pull up" or "pull down" the *mean* but don't affect the *median*

## Measures of spread

Four ways that we will measure the *spread* and *variability* of a data set:
- Range
- Inter-quartile range
- Standard deviation
- Variance

### Range

- Range is the *distance* between the maximum and minimum value 
- Note that range is a *single* number
- Range is simple to compute, but it is determined by the extreme values *only*

### Inter-quartile range (IQR)

- The distance between the 25$^t$$^h$ percentile (Q$_1$) and the 75$^t$$^h$ percentile (Q$_3$)
- Q$_3$ - Q$_1$
- IQR is *not* sensitive to extreme values, but is not using *all* of the data points

### Standard deviation

- The standard deviation of a data set is calculated using *all* of the data points

# Add picture here

- Use the formula for *s* when you only know X for a random sample of the entire population
- Use the formula for o when you know the X for the entire population (which is rare)
- In either case, the value of *s* or o is the *typical distance* between X and the mean value of X

### Variance 


### Skewness

- A distribution of data is *skewed* if it is significantly asymmetrical
