### 4. **Sets of Instructions**

#### **Task 1: Creating and Setting Up a New Design File**

- **Overview**: Begin by creating a new file in Figma and setting up the workspace for your design project.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Log in to Figma** and click the "New File" button.
    2. **Name your design file** by clicking the file name at the top of the interface.
    3. Use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create various frames (artboards) that match the screen size or device for your design.
    4. **Customize your workspace** by importing logos, assets, or branding guidelines.
- **Graphics**: Include screenshots showing how to create a new file and set up frames.

---

#### **Task 2: Using Layers and Frames**

- **Overview**: Organize your design with Figma's layer system and use frames to structure your interface elements.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Access the Layers Panel** by clicking the icon on the left to view all elements in your file.
    2. Use the **Frame Tool (F)** to create frames around different parts of your UI, like buttons or sections.
    3. **Rearrange layers** by clicking and dragging them within the panel.
    4. Enable **Auto Layout** to make frames dynamic and responsive to content changes.
- **Graphics**: Screenshots of the Layers panel, creating frames, and applying Auto Layout.

#### **Task 3: Prototyping and Interactions**

- **Overview**: Transform your static designs into interactive prototypes that simulate real user flows.
- **Steps**:
    1. Switch to the **Prototype** tab located in the right-hand panel.
    2. **Select a UI element**, like a button, and drag the blue arrow to link it to another frame (screen).
    3. Choose an **interaction type**, such as **"On Click"**, and add an animation, like **"Smart Animate"**, for smoother transitions.
    4. **Preview your prototype** by clicking the "Play" button in the top-right corner.
- **Graphics**: Screenshots showing prototyping interactions, linking frames, and previewing prototypes.

#### **Task 4: Collaborating with Team Members**

- **Overview**: Figma enables real-time collaboration, allowing multiple team members to work together on the same file.
- **Steps**:
    1. Click the **Share** button in the top-right corner of the Figma interface.
    2. **Invite team members** by entering their email addresses and setting access permissions (view or edit).
    3. Use the **Comment** tool by selecting an element and clicking the comment icon to leave feedback.
    4. Collaborate in real-time as changes are visible immediately, or review edits through the **Version History**.
- **Graphics**: Screenshots of the sharing and commenting features.

#### **Task 5: Exporting Assets**

- **Overview**: Once your design is complete, export assets such as icons, images, or entire frames for development or use in other tools.
- **Steps**:
    1. **Select the element or frame** you wish to export.
    2. In the right-hand panel, click **Export**, and select the desired format (PNG, SVG, PDF).
    3. Adjust the **resolution** (e.g., 1x, 2x) based on your requirements.
    4. Click **Export** to save the file to your computer.
- **Graphics**: Screenshots showing export options and resolution settings.

### 5. **Glossary**

- **Frame**: A container for organizing elements in your design, acting as a screen or artboard.
- **Layer**: An individual element or object in your design, like text or a shape, that can be grouped and rearranged.
- **Auto Layout**: A feature that makes frames dynamic and responsive, adjusting to the content within them.
- **Prototype**: An interactive version of your design used to simulate user flows and interactions.
- **Export**: Saving design elements from Figma as images or other file formats for external use.

---

### 6. **Troubleshooting Guide**

- **Issue**: Unable to share the design file.
    - **Solution**: Check that the correct email addresses are entered, and ensure file permissions are set to "Can edit" or "Can view."
- **Issue**: Prototypes not working properly.
    - **Solution**: Double-check that all frames are linked correctly and that youâ€™ve applied appropriate animations to the interactions.
- **Issue**: Slow performance on large files.
    - **Solution**: Consider breaking the project into multiple pages, and reduce the use of high-resolution images to improve performance.
