### 3. **Introduction**

- **Software Overview**: Figma is a web-based design tool used for interface design, wireframing, and prototyping. Its key features include real-time collaboration, vector editing, and the ability to create interactive prototypes.
- **Intended Audience**: UI/UX designers, product teams, developers, and design students.
- **Requirements**: An internet connection, a Figma account, a modern web browser, and some familiarity with design principles or vector-based tools like Sketch or Adobe XD.

### 4. **Sets of Instructions**

Each task should include an overview, clear steps, subheadings, and screenshots where necessary.

- **Task 1: Creating and Setting Up a New Design File**
    
    - **Overview**: Learn how to create and configure a new design file for your project in Figma.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Log into Figma and click on the "New File" button in your workspace.
        2. Name your file and choose the device frame (e.g., desktop, mobile) if needed.
        3. Use the "Frame Tool" (shortcut `F`) to set up different artboards or screen sizes.
        4. Adjust the background settings or import branding assets as necessary.
    - **Graphics**: Include screenshots showing how to create a new file and set up frames.
- **Task 2: Using Layers and Frames**
    
    - **Overview**: Learn how to organize designs using layers and frames, which act as containers for elements in Figma.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Open the Layers panel on the left to view all the objects in your design.
        2. Use the "Frame Tool" to create frames for sections or UI elements.
        3. Click and drag layers to reorder or group them.
        4. Use the "Auto Layout" feature to create responsive frames that adjust automatically.
    - **Graphics**: Screenshots of the Layers panel, frame creation, and auto layout settings.
- **Task 3: Prototyping and Interactions**
    
    - **Overview**: Create interactive prototypes that simulate user flows and app functionality.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Switch to the "Prototype" tab in the right-hand panel.
        2. Select an element (like a button) and drag the blue connector to the next screen to create a link.
        3. Choose interactions (e.g., "On Click") and define animations (e.g., "Smart Animate").
        4. Preview your prototype by clicking the "Play" button at the top.
    - **Graphics**: Include a screenshot of the prototyping interface and interaction settings.
- **Task 4: Collaborating with Team Members**
    
    - **Overview**: Figma allows multiple users to collaborate in real-time on the same design project.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Click the "Share" button in the top-right corner.
        2. Enter the email addresses of your collaborators and choose their access level (view or edit).
        3. Use the comments feature by selecting an object and clicking the "Comment" icon.
        4. Watch as team members make changes live, or review version history for past edits.
    - **Graphics**: Screenshots showing the sharing menu and real-time collaboration features.
- **Task 5: Exporting Assets**
    
    - **Overview**: Learn how to export your design assets (such as icons, images, or entire screens) from Figma for development.
    - **Steps**:
        1. Select the object or frame you want to export.
        2. In the right-hand panel, click "Export" and set the format (e.g., PNG, SVG, or PDF).
        3. Choose resolution and export settings based on your needs (1x, 2x for Retina displays).
        4. Click "Export" and download the file to your computer.
    - **Graphics**: Include screenshots of the export options and process.

### 5. **Glossary**

- Define key terms like "Frame," "Layers," "Prototyping," "Auto Layout," and "Export."
- Example: **Frame** – A container in Figma that holds design elements, typically used for organizing components like buttons, screens, or sections of a webpage.

### 6. **Troubleshooting Guide**

- Common problems and solutions, such as:
    - **Issue**: Cannot share the design file.
        - **Solution**: Ensure the collaborators’ emails are entered correctly and that your file sharing permissions are set to "Can edit" or "Can view."
    - **Issue**: Prototype transitions not working.
        - **Solution**: Check that the interaction is linked correctly, and verify that animation settings (e.g., "Smart Animate") are supported for the selected elements.
    - **Issue**: Slow performance when working on large files.
        - **Solution**: Reduce the number of high-resolution images or break large files into multiple components or pages.
